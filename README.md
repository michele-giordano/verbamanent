# VerbaManent

> *Words remain.*
> VerbaManent is an actively maintained open-source neural text-to-speech (TTS) engine.  
> It continues the work of Coqui-TTS with a renewed focus on quality, accessibility, and performance on consumer-grade hardware.

## âœ¨ Project Goals

VerbaManent was initiated as a fork of the discontinued Coqui-TTS project.  
Its purpose is to:

- preserve access to a functional and free TTS engine
- ensure long-term maintainability and stability
- refactor and modularize the codebase for clarity and reuse
- provide an ethical, open alternative to commercial TTS APIs

---

## ðŸ§© Current Status

This repository is a direct fork of the `dev` branch of Coqui-TTS, with branding and references updated.  
Functionality and compatibility with pre-trained models are fully preserved.  
Codebase restructuring and architectural improvements will begin in future versions.
